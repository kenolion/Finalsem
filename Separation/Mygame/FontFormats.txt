DT_BOTTOM
 Justify the text to the bottom of the rectangle. This value must be combined with DT_SINGLELINE.
 
DT_CALCRECT
 Tell DrawText to automatically calculate the width and height of the rectangle based on the length of the string you tell it to draw. If there are multiple lines of text, ID3DX10Font::DrawText uses the width of the rectangle pointed to by the pRect parameter and extends the base of the rectangle to bound the last line of text. If there is only one line of text, ID3DX10Font::DrawText modifies the right side of the rectangle so that it bounds the last character in the line. In either case, ID3DX10Font::DrawText returns the height of the formatted text but does not draw the text.
 
DT_CENTER
 Center text horizontally in the rectangle.
 
DT_EXPANDTABS
 Expand tab characters. The default number of characters per tab is eight.
 
DT_LEFT
 Align text to the left.
 
DT_NOCLIP
 Draw without clipping. ID3DX10Font::DrawText is somewhat faster when DT_NOCLIP is used.
 
DT_RIGHT
 Align text to the right.
 
DT_RTLREADING
 Display text in right-to-left reading order for bidirectional text when a Hebrew or Arabic font is selected. The default reading order for all text is left-to-right.
 
DT_SINGLELINE
 Display text on a single line only. Carriage returns and line feeds do not break the line.
 
DT_TOP
 Top-justify text.
 
DT_VCENTER
 Center text vertically (single line only).
 
DT_WORDBREAK
 Break words. Lines are automatically broken between words if a word would extend past the edge of the rectangle specified by the pRect parameter. A carriage return/line feed sequence also breaks the line.
